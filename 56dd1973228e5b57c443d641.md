# 请问Beta系数如何计算？

看了“帮助”中风险系数的计算公式，尝试自己计算风险系数。

可是得到的结果和“我的交易”中的风险指标不一致。

请问Beta系数具体如何计算呢？最好能举个例子～

Sr = [0,0,0,0,0,0.0455,0.0429,-0.0108,0.0213,0.0394,-0.0485,-0.0503,-0.0503,-0.0503,-0.0503,-0.0191,0.0018,0.0354]
Br = [0.0073,-0.0115,0.0091,-0.0231,-0.0193,0.0096,-0.0057,-0.0348,-0.0247,-0.0199,-0.0789,-0.0821,-0.1061,-0.0772,-0.0913,-0.0724,-0.0764,-0.0651]

其中Sr是策略的每日收益率，Br是基准的每日涨幅，请问对应的beta系数是什么～
