**Automatic one two three
**In this paper, we show how market-technical trends can be calculated automatically from underlying price processes using a stop and reverse process. The basic tool is a so called minmax process indicating all relevant minima and maxima. For the existence of the minmax process, we give a constructive proof. Several successful trend-following trading strategies can be implemented automatically based on this 1-2-3-trend indicator.

**Gaussian process-based algorithmic trading strategy identification
**Many market participants now employ algorithmic trading, commonly defined as the use of computer
algorithms, to automatically make certain trading decisions, submit orders and manage those orders after submission. Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants’ actions.

**Empirical properties of asset returns:stylized facts and statistical issues
**We present a set of stylized empirical facts emerging from the statistical analysis of price variations in various types of financial markets. We first discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of financial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described:distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.

**PAIRS TRADING
**“Pairs Trading” is an investment strategy used by many Hedge Funds. Consider two
similar stocks which trade at some spread. If the spread widens short the high stock and
buy the low stock. As the spread narrows again to some equilibrium value, a profit results.
This paper provides an analytical framework for such an investment strategy. We propose a
mean-reverting Gaussian Markov chain model for the spread which is observed in Gaussian
noise.
Predictions from the calibrated model are then compared with subsequent observations of
the spread to determine appropriate investment decisions.
The methodology has potential applications to generating wealth from any quantities in
financial market which are observed to be out of equilibrium.

**Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities Markets
**
We study model-driven statistical arbitrage strategies in U.S. equities.Trading signals are generated in two ways: using Principal Component Analysis and using sector ETFs. In both cases, we consider the residuals,or idiosyncratic components of stock returns, and model them as a meanreverting process, which leads naturally to “contrarian” trading signals.

**Optimal leverage from non-ergodicity
**This study focuses on the simple setup of self-financing investments, that is, investments whose gains and losses are reinvested without consumption or deposits of fresh funds, in assets whose prices are undergoing geometric Brownian motion. The consequences of time irreversibility pertaining to studies of risk are discussed.
Understanding these consequences appears particularly important in the light of the current financial and economic crisis. This will be elaborated at the end, in section 4, after establishing the main concepts.

**High-frequency trading in a limit order book
**We study a stock dealer’s strategy for submitting bid and ask quotes in a limit order book. The agent faces an inventory risk due to the diffusive nature of the stock’s mid-price and a transactions risk due to a Poisson arrival of market buy and sell orders. After setting up the agent’s problem in a maximal expected utility framework, we derive the solution in a two step procedure. First, the dealer computes a personal indifference valuation for the stock, given his current inventory. Second, he calibrates his bid and ask quotes to the market’s limit order book. We compare this ”inventory-based” strategy to a ”naive” best bid/best ask strategy by simulating stock price paths and displaying the P&L profiles of both strategies. We find that our strategy has a P&L profile that has both a higher return and lower variance than the benchmark strategy.

**Risk premia: asymmetric tail risks and excess returns
**One of the pillars of modern finance theory is the concept of ‘risk premium’, i.e. that a more risky investment should, on the long run, also be more profitable.

**Portfolio Selection with Higher Moments
**We build on the Markowitz portfolio selection process by incorporating higher order moments of the assets, as well as utility functions based on predictive asset returns. We propose the use of the skew normal distribution as a characterization of the asset returns. We show that this distribution has many attractive features when it comes to modeling multivariate returns. Preference over portfolios is framed in terms of expected utility maximization. We discuss estimation and optimal portfolio selection using Bayesian methods. These methods allow for a comparison to other optimization approaches where parameter uncertainty is either ignored or accommodated in a nontraditional manner. Our results suggest that it is important to incorporate higher order moments in portfolio selection. Further, we show that our approach leads to higher expected utility than the resampling methods common in the practice of finance.

**WHAT GOOD IS A VOLATILITY MODEL?
**A volatility model must be able to forecast volatility; this is the central requirement in
almost all financial applications. In this paper we outline some stylised facts about volatility that should be incorporated in a model; pronounced persistence and meanreversion,
asymmetry such that the sign of an innovation also affects volatility and the possibility of exogenous or pre-determined variables influencing volatility. We use data on the Dow Jones Industrial index to illustrate these stylised facts, and the ability of GARCH-type models to capture these features. We conclude with some challenges for future research in this area.
