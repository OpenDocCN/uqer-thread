Factor Investing: Implementation Costs Really Do Matter
『毁三观』因子投资：实操成本真的很重要
Posted by Gary Antonacci on November 26, 2017
Progress in science comes when experiment contradicts theory. – Richard Feynman
科学的进步来自于实验和理论的冲突 –理查德费曼
One of the tenets of modern portfolio theory is that you cannot generally beat the market after transaction costs. Yet academic researchers have shown that momentum consistently beats the market. Other factors besides momentum have also cast doubt on the efficacy of the efficient market hypothesis.
现代组合理论的信条是投资者在扣除手续费之后基本很难跑赢市场。但是学术研究者们表示动量投资老是可以战胜市场。动量背后的其他因子也总是证伪市场有效假设。
There is one way though that academics can still hold on to the efficient market hypothesis. It is to show that academic research on anomalies does not hold up in the real world after accounting for transaction costs.
有一种办法可以证明市场有效假设，就是学术研究不切合实际，没有计入交易成本。
Chen, Stanzl & Watanabe (2002) were the first to explore the price impact of factor investing. They concluded that the maximal fund sizes for factor-based anomalies, especially momentum, to remain profitable are too small. Lesmond, Shill & Zhou (2003), Korajczyk & Sadka (2004), Fisher, Shah & Titman (2015), Novy-Marx & Velikov (2015), Beck, Hsu, Kalesnik & Kostka (2016) all came to similar conclusions.
Chen，Stanzl等人是第一个研究费用对因子投资影响的。他们总结道：因为基于因子的不适配，在保持盈利性的前提下，基金规模（尤其是基于动量的）的容量有限。其他人也表示了相同的看法。
Fund sponsors who jumped on the factor bandwagon were not happy to see these results. Like what happens when drug companies have academics do trials of their products, fund sponsors had their own researchers look at the capacity of factor-based strategies.
基金发起人不乐意看到这些结果。 就像制药公司发现有学者对其产品进行试验时发生的情况一样，基金发起人也有自己的研究人员关注基于因子策略的容量。。
Frazzini, Israel & Moskowitz (2014) work for AQR. Ratcliffe, Miranda & Ang (2016) work for Black Rock. Both sets of authors put together studies showing large enough capacity for managing factor-based funds.
来自行业内的研究人员整合研究，也表达了相似的观点。
The drawback of all these studies, whether academic or industry based, is that they depend on assumptions about transaction costs and market liquidity. Assessing implementation costs using parametric transaction cost models may be incomplete or misguided. Ratcliffe et al. acknowledge this when they say, “The exercise we conduct in this paper is hypothetical and involves several unrealistic assumptions.”
这些研究的缺陷在于：都依赖于关于交易成本和市场流动性的前提假设。衡量实操成本的费用模型是不完整的、有误导性的。
Real World Results
真实世界中的结果
What we need is analysis of real world data without assumptions. In past blog posts here, here, and here, we highlighted some research along these lines. One study we cite is of value versus growth by Loughran & Hough (2006). After examining mutual fund performance from 1965 to 2001, they concluded that superior long-run performance from value is an “illusion.”
我们需要做的事分析真实世界的数据而不带前提假设。有一个例子是关于价值Vs成长的，在分析了从1965-2001年的共同基金数据后，他们总结道：源自价值的长期超额收益是一个“幻象”。
A second study is by Arnott, Kalesnik & Wu (2017). They applied two-stage Fama-MacBeth regression to the last quarter-century of mutual fund returns. They showed the real-world return for the value and market factors to be half or worse than theoretical factor returns.  On a real-time basis, the momentum factor provided no benefit whatever.
第二个研究对过去25年的共同基金收益跑了一个two-stage Fama-MacBeth regression，他们的研究表明：真实世界中基于因子的回报是理论因子回报的一半或更差。
Seminal Study
开创性研究
Two Duke professors, Patton & Weller (2017), recently came out with an authoritative study of real versus theoretical performance of momentum, value, and size factors called “What You See Is Not What You Get: The Costs of Trading Market Anomalies.” Their work reviews prior studies and builds on the research of Arnott et al. and others.
两位杜克大学的教授也做了研究，叫做“看到却得不到：交易中的成本“。
The authors start with a two-stage Fama-MacBeth regression applied to 7320 U.S. domestic mutual funds from January 1970 to December 2016. Using this, they determine the factor loadings for each fund and each factor. They then estimate the compensation per unit of factor exposure by using cross-sectional regressions.
教授对1970-2016年的本土共同基金做了“花式回归”。
Implementation Costs
实操成本
Their approach differs from the Arnott et al. one by focusing more explicitly on implementation costs and making improvements on how Fama-Macbeth regression is used. From 1970 through 2016, the authors find that annual implementation costs range from 2.2% to 8.5% for momentum strategies. This makes momentum profits inaccessible to typical asset managers, according to the authors.
作者发现动量策略的每年实操成本在2.2%-8.5%。这让大部分平庸的基金经理获取不到收益。
For value, the authors come up with annual implementation costs of 2.6% to 5%. They report that “after accounting for implementation costs, typical mutual funds earn low returns to value and no returns to momentum.”
对于价值类因子，每年的实操成本在2.6%-5%。剔除掉实操成本之后，大部分共同基金对价值类因子获取较少收益，动量类根本没收益。
Implementation costs for both value and momentum are stationary throughout this period. Industry inflows offset declines in bid-ask spreads and commissions.
对于价值类、动量类因子的实操成本在这段时间中保持了恒定。超额收益在买卖和佣金中浮浮沉沉。
In addition to Fama-MacBeth regressions, the authors use a second approach called matched pairs. Here they directly compare the compensation for stocks to mutual funds with similar characteristics. They sort stocks into quintiles and match them up with the three mutual funds closest to them in factor beta.
作者还用别第二种叫做配对的方法。他们直接比较了具有相似特征的股票和共同基金的收益。具体来讲他们是这么做的…..
The Fama-Macbeth approach shows that implementation costs erode almost all the return to value and momentum strategies of mutual funds.  But they have little impact on market and size strategies. Matched pairs analysis shows comparable performance attrition for value and momentum strategies. But it also shows high costs to trading small stock portfolios.
Fama-Macbeth的方法证明实操成本会毁了价值类、动量因子。但是对市场类和市值类策略影响很小。配对法证明小市值策略也有很高的实操成本。
In summary, the authors say the implementation gap is large and statistically significant for all the factors they examine. None of the factor strategies earn returns after real-world costs during the 1970 to 2016 period.
In future research, the authors say they will apply these tools to see if other residents of the factor zoo (such as low volatility and quality) can survive in the wild.
总结，作者表示长期看（1970-2016），这些因子在真实世界中无收益。他们还会用这种办法研究别的因子，比如低波动等。
Implications
启示
I wrote my first momentum paper in 2011. It was called “Optimal Momentum: A Global Cross Asset Approach.” [1] I looked at momentum applied to stocks, industries, investment styles, and geographic equity markets. I found that momentum worked best when used with geographically diversified stock indices.
In 2015, Geczy & Samonov (2015) applied momentum to U.S. stocks, global sectors, country equity indices, government bonds, currencies, and commodities. Looking at the past 215 years of data, they came to the same conclusion as I did. Momentum works best when applied to geographically diversified stock indices.
Neither my study nor Geczy & Samonov’s study took into account implementation costs, which would have made our results even stronger compared to stock momentum. Implementation costs are substantially lower when momentum is applied to stock indices rather than individual stocks.
我写过关于动量的论文，别的人也写过，都证明了会有收益，但是我们的研究却没有考虑实操成本，这回导致收益偏高。动量应用到指数投资时，实操成本会比单只股票小很多。
Momentum stocks are often volatile with wide bid-ask spreads. They have less liquidity than broad-based stock indices. Yet almost every momentum fund applies momentum to individual stocks rather than to country or regional stock indices.
Studies such as those by Arnott et al. and Patton & Weller may eventually get fund sponsors to pay attention to the implementation cost evidence against stock-based factor investing. But I wouldn’t count on it anytime soon. The growth of factor- based investing has been explosive and is expected to continue that way. 
基于动量的股票投资相较指数来说，流动性不足。但是大多数动量基金还是基于股票而不是指数。因子投资的市场有些拥挤了。
Ignoring implementation costs, there is still widespread belief that factors can enhance return or decrease risk.
因子可以增加收益，降低风险，这也是广泛的认知。
The same behavioral biases that make momentum effective also prevent financial professionals and investors from recognizing and acting on important new information.  That is what makes investing so interesting. Anchoring, slow diffusion of information, herding, and confirmation bias are alive and well.
最后来点正能量：行为偏差导致了投资者没能利用新信息采取行动。但这也是投资的魅力：锚定，信息不对称，羊群效应，偏误都生动的上演着。
